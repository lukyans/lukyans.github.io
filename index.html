    <h2>We Must Learn to Sharpen Focus</h2>
    <p>"We must learn to sharpen focus if we are to contend with, let alone thrive, in a complex world...
    For more than two decades, psychologist and journalist, author of "emotional intelligence" Daniel Goleman has been scouting the leading edge of the human sciences for what's new, surprising, and important. 
    In his new book "Focus", he delves into the science of attention in all its varieties, presenting a long overdue discussion of this little-noticed and under-rated mental asset that matters enormously for how we navigate life. 
    Attention works much like a muscle: use it poorly and it can wither; work it well and it grows. In an era of unstoppable distractions, Goleman persuasively argues that now more than ever we must learn to sharpen focus if we are to contend with, let alone thrive, in a complex world.</p>
